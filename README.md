# baby-names-analysis
In this repository, I store the analysis of a database taken from the site https://www.kaggle.com/. The database includes data on newborn children in different years with different names.
Top 10 Names & Popularity Trends (Last 10 Years)
This dashboard is built in Tableau based on the NationalNames dataset, which contains information about the number of newborns with certain names in different years and with a breakdown by gender.

Data
Name - name
Year - year the name was registered
Gender - gender (F or M)
Count - number of times the name was used in a given year for a specific gender
